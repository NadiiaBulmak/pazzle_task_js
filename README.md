- [DEMO LINK](https://nadiiabulmak.github.io/pazzle_task_js/)

This project solves the task of constructing the largest (longest) sequence from a set of digital fragments, where the connection between them is made by matching the first or last two digits of each fragment.

## Problem Description:
We are given a set of numeric strings, and each fragment can connect to another fragment if the first two digits of the second fragment match the last two digits of the first fragment. The goal is to assemble the largest possible sequence using all fragments exactly once.

**Example:**
For the strings:

## Features:
- The program accepts a file with fragments that consist only of digits.
- The result is the longest possible sequence of numbers formed by joining the fragments.

## Technologies:
- JavaScript
- HTML (for form creation)
